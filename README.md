LKAM-Net: Automatic crack segmentation network based on large kernel pooling attention mechanism and multi-scale edge enhancement
![main](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e35e572b-2e9d-4a51-b891-9794bc70bd70)

I have trained and tested the codes on
CUDA 12.1
Python 3.8, install required packages by pip install 

The code usage process is as follows: Train-test-statistics; Among them, net8 is the main network, and block1 is the network backbone Transformer

Download the training and testing datasets used for our model. In addition, we provided our feasibility study results in the original paper.
